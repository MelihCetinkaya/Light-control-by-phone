  This project is a remote light control system developed with ESP32, Spring Boot and Kotlin. Users can turn the light on and off via the mobile application.
ESP32's pin number 14 is used to control the light.
When ESP32 is powered, it connects to the API via WiFi.
Backend codes are in the main branch.
Mobile application codes are in the frontend branch.
You can test it in Android Studio.
